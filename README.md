## Features

* Money system
* Wallshop

* Sound / Particles
* Multi-player

* Zombie system with spawn, movement, and reward

## Current Status

The project is still in development, but due to the lack of time I am stoping working on this project.

## Current bugs

* When a new player joins the game, The ping will be so high (4,000ms instead of 70ms)
* The zombie walk path is different for each client (this is because zombie walk path in the scene is done on the client side)

## How to play:
1. download the repo
2. navigate to server `cd server`
3. start server `node server.js`
4. open /client2/index.html
5. have fun :)

Although we have encountered some issues, we are still making progress on the project. We are working diligently to resolve the zombie system issues and add new features to the game. We appreciate your patience and support.
